# 🗣 Retrieval Vocabulary

* **Chunk:** A piece of data or information, often a subset of a larger document, that will handled as a single unit by a retrieval system
* **Chunking:** The act of splitting your long body of text into smaller parts. Similar to text splitting.
* **Cosine Similarity:** A metric used to measure the similarity between two vectors (often representing text embeddings) in a multi-dimensional space, by calculating the cosine of the angle between them
* **Dimension Size:** The number of features or axes in the space, which corresponds to the size of the embeddings used for representing documents or chunks
* **Document Loader:** A component of a retrieval system that is responsible for importing documents into the system and preparing them for indexing and retrieval
* **Document Store (DocStore):** A specialized database for storing, managing, and retrieving documents within a retrieval system
* **Document:** A unit of data or information that can be text, image, audio, or video, which the system can retrieve and present in response to a query
* **Embedding:** A mathematical representation of a document or chunk, often in a high-dimensional space, where each dimension represents a feature such as a word or phrase. Similar to vector
* **Full Stack Retrieval:** The entire retrieval system that handles the everything from data ingestion, processing to query handling and information delivery
* **Index:** An index is a data structure that allows for fast retrieval of documents or chunks within a large dataset. It maps key terms or features to their locations in a dataset
* **Knowledge Base:** A structured database of facts, information, and rules that a retrieval system can draw upon to answer queries or perform tasks
* **Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR):** An algorithm used to provide a set of search results that are both relevant to the query and diverse, minimizing content overlap to offer a broader information range
* **Retriever:** In the context of retrieval systems, a retriever is a component that fetches relevant documents from a corpus or database based on a query, often using embeddings and similarity measures.
* **Sentiment:** The emotional tone or meaning behind a series of words, used to understand the attitudes, opinions, and emotions expressed in a chunk of text
* **Text Splitting:** Another way to say chunking. The act of splitting up your long body of text into smaller parts
* **Vector Store (VectorStore):** A database or storage system where vectors are kept. It allows for efficient retrieval and comparison of vectors for operations like similarity searching
* **Vector:** A mathematical representation of a document or chunk, often in a high-dimensional space, where each dimension represents a feature such as a word or phrase.
